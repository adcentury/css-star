CSS Star
========

Use only css to draw a five-pointed star.

The position of the star is set by the center of it (which is also the center of its Circumcircle), so you can controll it precisely.

[Example](http://codepen.io/leilei/pen/lGyjo?editors=110) is available at [my CodePen](http://codepen.io/leilei/public/)

## Usage

- copy **star.css** into your project directory

- load css file

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="star.css">
```

- generate star with a single div

```html
<div class="star"></div>
```

Enjoy it!
